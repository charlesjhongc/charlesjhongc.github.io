## About Me

hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Charles.

I'm a web3 freelancer. Former Solidity Engineer at [Tokenlon](https://tokenlon.im/). In general, I'm a goal-oriented developer continuously learning new things to solve problems.

Here are some principles I follow in my work:

- Do it once and do it well
- Impact over effort
- Simplicity over premature optimization
- Pragmatism over Perfectionism
